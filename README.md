IslandBoi is one of the final projects we made at Le-Wagon Bootcamp.
It is taken from the concept of "AirBnB" and translated to a website where you can rent private islands or rent out your private island to others.

<b>Please inspect and look with a mobile-view as the project is mobile-view only for now.</b>
